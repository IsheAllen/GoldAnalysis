Gold Price Analysis and Visualization

Project Overview

This is a holiday project I worked on to learn more about data analysis and visualization techniques. The project analyzes historical gold price data to uncover trends, patterns, and actionable insights for investors. Using Python and a Kaggle dataset, I explored financial metrics such as moving averages, daily returns, volatility, and momentum indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI).

Key Features

	•	Gold Prices with Moving Averages:
	•	Identifies trends and momentum shifts using 50-day and 200-day moving averages.
	•	Highlights Golden Cross (bullish) and Death Cross (bearish) signals.
	•	Daily Returns:
	•	Explores short-term price fluctuations and high/low volatility periods.
	•	Volatility Analysis:
	•	Measures the rolling standard deviation of daily returns to capture market activity.
	•	Relative Strength Index (RSI):
	•	Detects overbought (>70) and oversold (<30) conditions for trading opportunities.
	•	Correlation Heatmap:
	•	Shows relationships between key features like price, returns, volatility, and RSI.

 Technologies Used

	•	Python: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
	•	Jupyter Notebook: Interactive analysis and visualization
	•	GitHub: Repository for code sharing
 How to Run the Project

	1.	Clone this repository:git clone https://github.com/IsheAllen/GoldAnalysis.git
 	2.	Navigate to the project folder:cd GoldAnalysis
  3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:jupyter notebook notebooks/EDA_Gold_Analysis.ipynb
  4. Kaggle Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zeesolver/usd-gold-detail?resource=download
  5. Save the datasets into a dataset folder
  6. you should have the following directory in the gold analysis: notebooks(containing jupyter noteboook),dataset(containing all datasets),outputs(cleaned and enhanced data),scripts(all python code)
  7. there are additional run_cleaning (run it to clean data) and run_features(to test your features)
